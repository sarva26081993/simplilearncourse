project is a short term activity , whereas product is a outcome of those activities 

Advantages: 
1. simple model and requirements are defined at the very beginning, thus it will give clear idea to other teams about their work(like how to do and what to do)
2. project artifacts created at each phase for example: class diagram, ER diagram, BRD can be reused for another similar project as all the phases of waterfall SDLC are appearing to be well documented


Disadvantages:
1. chances of client unsatisfaction may lead to complete rework
2. changes in requirement will be hard to occupy once the project has been deployed at client side
3. testing beginning at very late in the waterfall model, so what if there is a ambiguity in requirement understanding itself
